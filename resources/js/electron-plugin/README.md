# @nativephp/electron-plugin

The Electron back-end for NativePHP.

## Development

When making changes to the Electron plugin you need to run `npm run build:watch` from this plugin directory.

You'll only see the changes after restarting NativePHP with `native:serve`.

## Issues

Please raise any issues on the [NativePHP/laravel](https://github.com/NativePHP/laravel/issues) repo.
